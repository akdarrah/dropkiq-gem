## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dropkiq'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dropkiq

## Usage

This Gem makes several assumptions about your Ruby on Rails application:

* Drop classes are expected to have the same name as the corresponding Rails model. For example, if you have an ActiveRecord model with name of `Person`, the drop class is expected to be called `PersonDrop`
* Drop class methods are expected to return the same data type as the corresponding Rails-model getter methods for relationships and columns.
* This Gem has not been tested with Rails models that have non-default primary key (other than `id`).

This Gem provides a rake command to generate a schema file that can be used to manage Fixtures on Dropkiq. Create the `db/dropkiq_schema.yaml` file by running the following command:

```
bundle exec rake dropkiq:schema
```

You should now have a `db/dropkiq_schema.yaml` file. This file describes all tables associated to Drop classes in your application, along with all methods avaialble to the Drop class. It is important that you **DO** allow this file to be checked in to version control so that you can maintain your Dropkiq schema over time as you add/remove/modify your Drop classes.

Notice that `type` has NOT been set on all methods. The Dropkiq Gem is only able to infer the method type for methods that correspond to a column or relationship on the ActiveRecord model. Please take a moment to manually add `type` values for all methods that were not able to be inferred. Notice that if you run `bundle exec rake dropkiq:schema` again, your changes are saved!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
